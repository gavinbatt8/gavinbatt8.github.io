      <p>
        Hi, I’m Gavin Batt — a sophomore at Needham High School passionate about leadership, learning, and building projects that make an impact. I balance AP coursework with a wide range of activities: I’ve played varsity tennis since freshman year, worked at a local pizzeria, and volunteered weekly at my temple for three years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also an Eagle Scout candidate, a long-time camper at Camp Kawaga, and a board member for SCOPE (1 year), where I’ve helped raise $10,000 to send underprivileged kids to summer camp. On top of that, I’ve earned the Seal of Biliteracy in both French and Mandarin and am launching my school’s Student Leadership Network to give peers opportunities to grow their skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of everything I do, I love playing tennis, hanging out with my friends, collaborating with others, and finding ways to leave a lasting impact on my community.
      </p>

  <h2>My Workflow</h2>
  <p>
    I like to keep things simple, clear, and moving. Every project starts with a plan — not because I’m afraid of improvising, but because I know that structure lets me move faster. I stay organized so I can outwork my peers, keep momentum, and actually finish what I start.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m not the type to let ideas sit in a notebook. If something’s worth doing, I’ll find a way to build it, test it, and get it out into the world. That means working in short, focused bursts: <strong>plan → build → review → refine</strong>. Along the way, I use AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude as creative partners — helping me brainstorm, troubleshoot, and iterate without losing flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result? Fewer “what ifs” and more “here it is.”
